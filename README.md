# TelecomChurnCaseStudyKaggle

The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive model should fill the following purposes:
It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

Even though overall accuracy will be your primary evaluation metric, you should also mention other metrics like precision, recall, etc. for the different models that can be used for evaluation purposes based on different business objectives. For example, in this problem statement, one business goal can be to build an ML model that identifies customers who'll definitely churn with more accuracy as compared to the ones who'll not churn. Make sure you mention which metric can be used in such scenarios.

Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.
